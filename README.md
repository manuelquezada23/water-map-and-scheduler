### 1.2 Purpose
* What problem does your project try to solve?
  * The goal of this project is to improve access to water and encourage regular water drinking by college students. It aims to target Brown students and make use of sustainable water sources. The project would be able to remind a user of the need to drink water and help them identify the nearest water access point. It also shows people how much water they should be drinking in a day. By allowing people to find publicly accessible water it will also allow people to utilise reusable water bottles reducing plastic waste, improve hygiene and make people’s lives easier. 
* Who does this problem affect? How?
  * Many college students forget to drink water and fill up their water bottles and they do not know of all the sustainable water sources around them. Many people buy and refrigerate bottled water because it is “easier”. They are not aware of the water options around them and we hope to show these options and encourage this behaviour.
* Why and how does your project help solve this problem?
  * Our project will provide a map-based application where users will be able to submit and find locations where one can find access to public water. This would be better than existing approaches such as WeTap because we’ll include indoor data as well, such as the water bottle fillers in Faunce.
There will also be functionality to rate the quality and standard of the water location. This will ensure that the locations are real locations and the community feedback will improve the quality of the application.
Users can choose ro register with the website in which case they can receive updates throughout the day reminding them of their water drinking goals and where and when they can fill up their water bottles.
* Why choose to solve this problem over others?
  * We think that increasing access to free clean water is extremely important and a right everyone should have. In Paris there is an amazing public water system, along with an app similar to the one we are describing. We want to create this app to improve access to free clean water. We would like to reduce waste from plastic water bottles.
